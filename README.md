Person A: So does the sun rotate spin and move(function)?
Person B: Yes the sun moves normally as always...
Person A:Are chocolate sales rising when it's sunny?
Person B:No....
Person A:well 4 things happen:1) slang language calls chocolates "a fairy tale"..2)it's obvious they don't function ok when it's sunny at least the sales department... 3) They don't know the word slang(because they speak only greek) 4) even if all of the above was not true(but it is) they don't care about cat/cats or making a hello world program in R programming language...
